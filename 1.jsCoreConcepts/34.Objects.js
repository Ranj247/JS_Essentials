/*
Objects, which are data structures in JavaScript that store data in property:value pairs. Objects in JavaScript are just like "objects" in real life: they have properties and methods. for example: a car has properties like color, number of seats, price and so on. It also has methods like start, stop, drive, reverse and so on. Every car is a unique object but they all have similar properties and methods. It's the same in JavaScript.

To define an object in JavaScript, you simply wrap a set of comma-separated property:value pairs in { curly braces }:

let object = {
  property1: value1,
  property2: value2,
  property3: value1,
}
*/

let car = {
  color: 'white',
  numberOfSeats: 5,
  price: 20000
}
console.log(car);

/*
The values can be any data type you wish: integers, strings, arrays, functions, even other objects. Each object also has a number of built in functionalities, such as getting the properties of it, setting new properties, changing values of existing properties and so on. You'll explore this functionality over the next couple of units.
