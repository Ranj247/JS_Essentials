/*
In JavaScript, like other programming languages, there are several different data types. Some of these include numbers, strings, booleans, and objects. Sometimes it's useful to know the type of data you're working with, and conveniently JavaScript comes with an operator for just that purpose: typeof.

The typeof operator can be used either as a function or as an operator. To determine the type of data you're working with, all you need to do is provide typeof with the data, and it will return its type. Here are a few examples:

console.log(typeof 1);                        // "number"
console.log(typeof 'Hello world!');           // "string"
console.log(typeof true);                     // "boolean"
console.log(typeof ['a', 'b', 'c']);          // "object"
console.log(typeof {name: 'John', age: 30});  // "object"
